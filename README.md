my random python code

In here i shall put a description of all my code.


 Python:

(**/Python**)
\
\
\
 Vignerre (.py) -> A user friendly Vignerre cipher encoder and decoder using known keywords.

 Vignerre Cribber (.py) -> A modified (slightly less user friendly) vignerre decrypter that will **check for a crib** that has been **encrypted** with one of a the **given keywords** in an **already encrypted message** to **check** if the **potential keyword is correct**.
 
 Caesar Cipher (.py) -> A (hopefully) very **user friendly Caesar Cipher encrypter and decrypted** with the option of **brute force decryption**.

 Affine Cipher (.py) -> A currently **manual Affine cipher encrypter and decrypter**, however it is **currently** just **set to brute force decrypting** for the **given message**.

 RSA (.py) -> A **kindof user friendly RSA encrypter and decrypter**. (RSA is the **prime number and mod numbers cipher** that is pretty much **one way**) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)
\
\
\
   Error Gen:

  (**/Python/Error Gen**)
  
   \\ Error Genorator (.py) -> Some fun code i made for **generating and reading error messages**

   Error (.txt) -> the **text file** the **error generator reads** from and **writes** to
\
\
\
  Abandoned (Projects that will probably never be revisited):
  
  (**/Python/Abandoned**)
  
   Smart Calculator (.py) -> A **calculator** that would be able to work like a normal one but **simplify algebra** as well. (so it would do: 3x + 4x -2y **= 7x - 2y**)
